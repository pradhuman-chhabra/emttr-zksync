        <ul>
          <p>
            Our vision is to carry out research on new EMTTRs models that
            incorporate technology and which aims at revolutionizing the medical
            scene around the world. EHRs is a technology solution designed
            specifically to address the needs of the medical eco-system
            comprising of medical laboratories, diagnostic labs, R&D
            organizations etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            EMTTR utilizes a distributed computer network platform that enables
            databases to store time-stamped transaction records and documents.
            Each server (or node) in the network processes and verifies each
            data entry, then archives all transactions, along with the history
            trail, which is every transaction ever recorded to the network.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data stored in a blockchain is essentially impossible to hack,
            infringe, or steal, because the ledger is not kept on a single
            repository, but is spread throughout multiple databases in replicate
            copies. These verification requirements ensure that stored data
            remains intact and immutable. Optimism blockchain is a safe and
            secure platform for storing and processing all types of valuable
            information, from clinical trial analysis results to business
            workflow documents to patients’ medical data and blueprints of
            genetic information.

          <h5>Advantages</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Storing safe data</li>
            <li>Speeding up clinical trials</li>
            <li>Ultimately lowering drug development costs</li>
            <li>Patient Privacy and Data Integrity</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>
            EMTTRs will be able to directly increase the quantity and quality of
            patients enrolled for clinical trials in a number of ways. This type
            of distributed ledger could allow individual patients to store their
            medical data by anonymous methods, thereby making it visible to
            trial recruiters, who could then reach out to the patients if their
            data qualifies for the clinical trial.
          </p>
          <p>
            It could also streamline the communication between doctors and
            patients during the trial. Blockchain has the tools to provide smart
            contracts that endorse transparency and traceability over clinical
            trial sequences, and can provide financial incentives for a
            patient’s participation and sharing of their data.

        <h1 className="section-heading">APPROACH & SOLUTION</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Transparency</strong>: EMTTR utilises a distributed
            computer network platform that enables databases to store
            time-stamped transaction records and documents.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Uniformity</strong>: Data is processed to make it
            uniform and stored. Also, records are encrypted to avoid any
            tampering of the data over the course of time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Analytics</strong>: Data collected over a secured and
            transparent network can be anonymized and further utilized for
            analysis and improvement study.
